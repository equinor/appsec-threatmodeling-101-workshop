# Threat modeling the SDLC</br>‚àû

SDLC = Software/System Development Life Cycle<!-- .element: style="font-size:0.8em"-->

---

# Threat modeling effort

- Most security effort is going into security for the systems that</br> we have deployed, the applications in production
- What about the various components/parts of our SDLC?
- Supply chain attacks are in the wind
- The SDLC contains many attack vectors

## A traditional view of a SDLC

## A more realistic view of a SDLC

## Threat modeling our SDLC

<div style="display: grid;grid-column-gap: 1%; grid-auto-columns: 50% 50%;">
 <div  style="grid-area: 1 / 1;font-size:0.7em"">

### What could possibly go wrong?

1. Scope - which part/information flow of the SDLC are we focusing on?
2. Follow the code?
3. What can go wrong?
4. What are we going to do about it?
5. Did we do a good job?

## Getting started

<div><!-- .element: style="font-size:0.8em"-->

- Identify and document security requirements.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Document SDLC (How we work, develop)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Document runbook (How we operate)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- Select threat model strategy<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
  - Part(s)/component(s) of the SDLC<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->
  - Information flow - follow the code<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" -->
- Apply STRIDE (what could go wrong?)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="7" -->
- Discuss & prioritise mitigations (what are we going to do about it?)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="8" -->
- Assess approach/results from SDLC threat modeling in team retrospective<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="9" -->

</div>

<hr>

‚ùóÔ∏èAvoid the "perfect" document/model syndrome. Start small, iterate. This goes for security requirements, the SDLC documentation, the runbook etc. Think life cycle - what documentation do we intend to maintain and keep up to date?<!-- .element: style="font-size:0.8em"--><!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="10" -->

## Exercise 4 - Threat modeling a SDLC

---

## EX-4: Doing an <u>end-to-end</u> threat model

<hr>

<div align="left"><!-- .element: style="font-size:0.7em"-->

In this exercise we will apply the skills we have acquired in the previous exercises to a fictive SDLC.

Group tasks:

- Examine the system, the SLDC, the assumptions and security requirements
- Select a <u>flow/part</u> of the example SDLC üëá
- Create a DFD diagram
- Identify threats using STRIDE
- For threats, select strategy, identify mitigations
- Document assumptions and security requirements
- Prepare to present results to class

<hr>

‚è∞ Time boxed schedule (40m):

- 10 + 10 + 10 + 10= 40 to threat model
