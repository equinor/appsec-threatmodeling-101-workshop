# Threat modeling 101

---

## Workshop objective

> Help teams to build and operate more secure systems by incorporating threat modeling into their daily work.

---

## Please note

There are many models and frameworks for doing threat modeling. In this workshop we teach one selected approach. We believe this will be a good starting point for most teams. As teams practices mature - we hope they will explore alternative ways of doing threat modeling. 

<hr>
There is no end state for application security, we just learn and improve.
