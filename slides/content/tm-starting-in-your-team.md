Group task:

Given our objective, consider your actual team/context. Explore some of questions below:

- For TM, "what is the first thing we will suggest for our team when we get back home"?
- What do we need to do to make TM a consistent part of "what we do"?
- What external help do we need, and when?

Take notes. Anonymize if needed. Post result to workshop slack channel [#appsec-threatmodeling-workshop](https://equinor.slack.com/archives/C046T5B84P4).
